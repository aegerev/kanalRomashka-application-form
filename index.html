        <p> Young children need a variety of academic and social-emotional skills to succeed inside and outside the classroom. That's why Kanal Romashka utilizes a "whole-child approach" to preparing children for life, offering media that supports key developmental areas â€” from communication, social and emotional development, and critical thinking skills to literacy and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math).
            <br/> <br/>
        Kanal Romashka is considered by many to be the "new PBS KIDS". Because of that, we're utilizing the PBS KIDS catalog - a catalog of shows that have helped boost kids' educational development. They need positive role models - Mister Rogers, Arthur, the Kratt Brothers - to help them grow. Add in shows like Smeshariki, Smeshariki: Pin-Kod, The Little Mermaid, the Little Mermaid: New Adventures, and Mad Money w/Jim Cramer, and you have the new PBS KIDS. <p>
            <br/> <br/>
        If you feel you can contribute to our mission, please apply. We will consider your application for future needs and opportunities.

        <br/> <br/>

        Together, we're going to continue Fred Rogers' legacy if PBS doesn't want to. </p>
